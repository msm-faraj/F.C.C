              <strong>1940s</strong> brBorn in the heat of battle, the Go
              Anywhere. Do Anything.® Jeep® Brand 4x4 emerged a hero to
              thousands of Allied soldiers around the world. The equally heroic
              civilian Jeep Brand vehicles of the 1940s firmly established the
              Jeep Brand as the undisputed leader in 4x4 technology.

              <strong>1950s</strong> The 1950s saw the rise of the recreation
              vehicle, as well as engineering superiority. Grass-roots
              enthusiasts helped launch Jeep® Jamborees and took the original
              freedom machine to new heights in sales thanks to seven unique
              models.

              <strong>1960s</strong> The All-New Jeep® Wagoneer represented
              unparalleled refinement and innovation. Prestige and individuality
              ruled the day. The Jeep Brand lineup grew to include 14 models—for
              work, play, recreation and luxuriously capable transportation.

              <strong>1970s</strong> The Jeep® Brand's 4x4 leadership continues
              in the 70s with the introduction of the first full-time 4x4
              system. The sporty 2-door full-size Cherokee (SJ) sweeps the 4x4
              of the Year awards. Six models help elevate sales to all-time
              highs.

              <strong>1980s</strong> The All-New Jeep® Cherokee (XJ) helped
              revolutionize the 4x4 market. The mighty XJ introduced many
              industry firsts, including: the first compact 4-door SUV, first
              UniFrame construction, and first full-time 4x4 system with
              shift-on-the-fly capability.

              <strong>1990s</strong> The All-New 1993 Jeep® Grand Cherokee (ZJ)
              set a new industry benchmark thanks to its unique balance of on-
              and off-road capability. The super-capable Wrangler (TJ) with its
              new coil suspension was introduced in 1997. In 1999 the new Grand
              Cherokee (WJ) was marketed as the most capable SUV ever. Sales
              soared to 629K units for the decade.

              <strong>2000s</strong> The radical 2003 Jeep® Wrangler Rubicon was
              the most capable vehicle ever produced by the Jeep Brand. A new
              4-door Wrangler took the industry by storm. The Compass and
              Patriot were the first Jeep Brand vehicles to reach into the small
              cross-utility segment.

              <strong>2010s</strong> The Jeep® Brand resonated with consumers
              around the world as global sales increased to their highest point
              in its over 75-year history with 1.41 million units sold worldwide
              for 2016. Strategic launches of the All-New Grand Cherokee,
              Renegade, Compass and the legendary Wrangler all contributed
              greatly to the Brand’s success.

              <strong>2020s</strong> The Jeep® Brand began this decade by
              reflecting the different needs of adventure lovers, bringing back
              a classic and introducing future-facing technology. The momentum
              started in 2019 when the Jeep Brand re-introduced the Jeep
              Gladiator pickup and entered the new decade with a bang by
              launching the first-ever three-row Jeep Grand Cherokee L, the
              incredibly powerful Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 and two of the many
              upcoming future-facing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles—the
              all-new Jeep Wrangler 4xe and the two-row Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe,
              coming spring 2022. Moving forward, the all-new Wagoneer and Grand
              Wagoneer take the premium SUV class into uncharted territories of
              style, comfort and adventure and the new Jeep Compass comes
              complete with experience-enhancing interior and capability
              upgrades.
